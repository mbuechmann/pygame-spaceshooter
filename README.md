pygame-spaceshooter
===================

This is a simple project to let me learn python and pygame.

I already implemented this game in Java using Google's PlayN framework. I am just interested in the 
differences between using python/pygame and Java/PlayN. But i have to finish this litte game first...


Greeting, Malte
